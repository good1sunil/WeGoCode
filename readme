This file will tell you how to run the code and what has been covered.

1. You will see the page object model in this project
2. However you will be running only "FleetandDeport" file.
	Right click on File->Run As->Test NG
3. The file "WeGoAddOrderPage" contains all the locators and also the methods.
4. I have written all the methods in WeGoAddOrderPage.java file and those method I called out in FleetandDeport.
5. For csv file. I have tried to upload it from source code only but somehow it's not working .So I selected the file from my local machine. So you have to update the path in the WeGoAddOrderPage.java file 

      String s = new String("Your Machine path for csv");
